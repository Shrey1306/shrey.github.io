Hi! I'm Shrey, a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech specializing in Intelligence and Information Internetworks. I'm passionate about building systems that solve real-world problems, particularly at the intersection of AI & Systems.

#### What I Do

I'm currently working on exciting projects in AI inference and Distributed Systems. At <a href="https://www.twilio.com/en-us/why-twilio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twilio</a>, I'm helping secure API infrastructure for millions of developers. Previously at <a href="https://www.mindtickle.com/why-mindtickle/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=ads&utm_campaign=Sitelink-ads-asset&utm_term=why-mindtickle&utm_content=learn-more&qgad=747521569414&qgterm=mindtickle&utm_source=google&utm_medium=ads&utm_campaign=&utm_adgroup=&utm_content=request-demo&utm_term=mindtickle&matchtype=b&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=13115642530&gbraid=0AAAAADpBzJiKqbJbmZjF9aKirmTdUb2Li&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_8rBBhCFARIsAJrc9yAB8eII6PWn4Uexrire7hyaxTREZjTjywK_Z4zNR-yArYHS0lq-q9AaAr2ZEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mindtickle</a>, I built performance optimization tools that reduced page load times by 65% and saved hundreds of engineering hours.

#### Technical Expertise

I love working with:
- <b>Languages</b>: Python, Java, C++, Go, and the MERN / Next.js stack for the web
- <b>AI/ML</b>: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- <b>Cloud</b>: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Vercel and microservices
- Exploring new technologies and contributing to OSS [currently vLLM]
