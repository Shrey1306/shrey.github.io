Hi! I'm Shrey, a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech specializing in Intelligence and Information Internetworks. I'm passionate about building systems that solve real-world problems, particularly at the intersection of AI & Systems.

## What I Do

I'm currently working on exciting projects in AI inference and Distributed Systems. At Twilio, I'm helping secure API infrastructure for millions of developers. Previously at Mindtickle, I built performance optimization tools that reduced page load times by 65% and saved hundreds of engineering hours.


## Technical Expertise

I love working with:
- **Languages**: Python, Java, C++, Go, and the MERN / Next.js stack for the web
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, vLLM OpenSource Project
- **Cloud**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Vercel and microservices


## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I'm:
- Mentoring student athletes at Georgia Tech
- Contributing to Atlanta's startup ecosystem through Startup Exchange
- Writing about technology and AI on my [Substack](https://substack.com/@sgupta1306)
- Exploring new technologies and contributing to open-source projects
