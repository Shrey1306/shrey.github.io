I want to understand reasoning. Not just as a heuristic. But to build up to the best version of it's meaning and how it can truly be mimicked. Understand why, "why" works. 

I believe we all follow Girard's mimetic theory (we tend to mimic other's desires). Since reasoning generates novelty and solves problems. Does the first true understanding of an entity's reasoning posit that it can be mimicked to every other entity. What's the general solution to "reasoning"?

The notion of a question word triggers a process that is either resolved through intuition or insight. Intuition is a mapping to past knowledge. Strong intuition will solve most problems. Insight will generate new solutions. Insight takes deep, reflective, slow brain processing. It takes "reasoning.."

So what is reasoning?
