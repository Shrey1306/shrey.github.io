Built a multi-agent orchestrator that automates the entire software development lifecycle from idea to execution.
Engineered a team of specialized AI agents (Dent, Rachel, Alfred, Gordon, Scarecrow) working in parallel to generate PRDs, 
system designs, and production-grade code with comprehensive test coverage.

Implemented a manifest-driven architecture using AWS Lambda and S3 for scalable deployment and runtime hosting, enabling rapid transformation 
of abstract ideas into fully functional, testable software systems within minutes. (Logs delivered through AWS CloudWatch)

Currently in development: a human-in-the-loop collaboration system with real-time editing capabilities and integrated security 
monitoring through the Robin framework for safe and responsible AI-driven development.
